# Final Skeleton
#
# Hints/Reminders from Lab 4:
# 
# To send an OpenFlow Message telling a switch to send packets out a
# port, do the following, replacing <PORT> with the port number the 
# switch should send the packets out:
#
#    msg = of.ofp_flow_mod()
#    msg.match = of.ofp_match.from_packet(packet)
#    msg.idle_timeout = 30
#    msg.hard_timeout = 30
#
#    msg.actions.append(of.ofp_action_output(port = <PORT>))
#    msg.data = packet_in
#    self.connection.send(msg)
#
# To drop packets, simply omit the action.
#
